<p>A groundbreaking Retina display. Powerful dual-core and quad-core Intel processors. Fast flash storage. High-performance graphics. Great built-in apps. And now in the 13-inch model, a revolutionary new Force Touch trackpad and even longer battery life.1 Whatever you can imagine, MacBook Pro with Retina display gives you the power to create.</p>
<p>The design of MacBook Pro packs a lot of power into not a lot of space. Because we believe that high performance shouldn’t come at the expense of portability. And despite being so compact, the new 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Pro with Retina display models now deliver up to 10 hours and nine hours of battery life, respectively — an hour more than the previous models.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With Multi-Touch in OS X, you can use realistic gestures like swiping or pinching to switch between apps, navigate your content and get the most out of your desktop space.</p>
<p>The new Force Touch trackpad takes all the capabilities of Multi-Touch and adds force sensors that detect subtle differences in the amount of downward pressure you apply. This lets you have a deeper connection to your content, bringing more functionality to your fingertip. It also introduces haptic feedback to MacBook Pro — allowing you to not just see what’s happening on the screen, but to feel it.</p>

<p>A groundbreaking Retina display. Powerful dual-core and quad-core Intel processors. Fast flash storage. High-performance graphics. Great built-in apps. And now in the 13-inch model, a revolutionary new Force Touch trackpad and even longer battery life.1 Whatever you can imagine, MacBook Pro with Retina display gives you the power to create.</p>
<p>The design of MacBook Pro packs a lot of power into not a lot of space. Because we believe that high performance shouldn’t come at the expense of portability. And despite being so compact, the new 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Pro with Retina display models now deliver up to 10 hours and nine hours of battery life, respectively — an hour more than the previous models.</p>

<p>With Multi-Touch in OS X, you can use realistic gestures like swiping or pinching to switch between apps, navigate your content and get the most out of your desktop space.</p>
<p>The new Force Touch trackpad takes all the capabilities of Multi-Touch and adds force sensors that detect subtle differences in the amount of downward pressure you apply. This lets you have a deeper connection to your content, bringing more functionality to your fingertip. It also introduces haptic feedback to MacBook Pro — allowing you to not just see what’s happening on the screen, but to feel it.</p>
