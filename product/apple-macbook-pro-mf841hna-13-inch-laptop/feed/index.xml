					<description><![CDATA[have had this laptop for 10 days or so, and these are my thoughts -

I am a long time Windows User and what I love in a Laptop are two things - Resolution (w/ Screen Quality), Performance and Build Quality. Now, make no mistake - this is not by any means the highest resolution laptop you can get. (Dell XPS 13 sports a ~4K screen). But what people forget is one thing -
Windows. Scaling. Sucks.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is my second device from Apple.In the past i have used a bunch of laptops and usually switch them after a year and so.Mostly i bought products from HP and lenovo.The last one was Lenovo Ideapad Y510,which was kind of a good device but bad battery life for a traveler like me.
So, the main reason i bought the macbook pro was the good battery life and excellent performance it offered.
Apple MacBook Pro MF840HN/A is the latest version of this one http://amzn.to/1EvEWcb]]></description>
